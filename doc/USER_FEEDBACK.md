## User Feedback
	- really like how the screen can follow the main player
	- impressed by the ability of the main player to collide with objects and generate a response
	- really fun to play
	- didn't like the fact that there was no running authoring environment available
	- thought that jumps should only occur when the player is on the ground (no infinite jumping)
	- confused that the main player shot off the screen when up was held
	- liked the idea of the versatility of using groovy script
	- confused that the koopa on the screen stopped when collided with main player instead of being deleted.
