# TEAM CONTRACT
### By signing this document, I swear to give my life to the VOOGASalad:
### Team Rules
- Promise to respect each other’s ideas and work.
-  Promise to be active team members and do our fair share of the work as best as we can.
-  Promise to do our work on time or communicate proactively with the team if there will be a delay.
 - Promise to help our fellow team members when they need it.
Promise to communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project. 

### Code Rules
- If I need another member’s code to be changed, I will ask them to change their own code. With their consent, I can make my own changes. I WILL NOT edit or change code without the owner’s consent. 

### Code Conventions:
- camelCase is required for all variable names
- Variable names that make sense and allow our code to be readable
- All methods start with a lowercase letter and are written in camelCase
- All class names start with a capital letter

### No Automatic Fail Conditions:
- If (true) return true
- Catching an exception by printing the stack trace
- As Generic a type as possible (List, Set not LinkedList/ArrayList, HashSet/TreeSet)
- Will always use ‘{’ and ‘}’ with conditional statements and loops
- Organized classes in this order: imports, class definition, final variables, instance variables, class constructor(s), methods.
- Methods Under ‘15’ Lines
- Implement Polymorphism at all opportunities. 
- Use modular code.
