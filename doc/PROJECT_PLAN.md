### Execution Plan
A large portion of the programming will be done through pair programming. This will ensure that more than one person knows how each part of the code works and that the code is easy to follow. It will also limit the number of features being worked on at once and decrease the chances of overlapping with other teammates. 

By the end of the first sprint, we plan to have a simple functioning game. This means that the authoring environment will be able to create characters and objects with behaviors and properties and an end of level aspect. It will be able to write the game as an XML document that can be read and executed by the game engine and game player. Creating objects rather than their interactions with one another is the priority for this sprint.

By the end of the second sprint, we plan enable the user to create events, characters, and objects that all interact with each other in their own way - determined by the user. For a challenge, we want the user to be able to share their scores and thought about the game on their social media platforms. We also plan to make a game out of making a game. This might include something like having a character move and place the objects on the game rather than the user doing it him or herself.
